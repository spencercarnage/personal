          My name is Spencer Carney. "Spencer Carnage" is a silly moniker that I
          gave myself as a teenager where I was skateboarding a lot and drinking
          40s with friends. Think "Sid Vicious" but waaaaay less cool. Made
          sense at the time.

        <p>
          I have been doing front-end development for {
            now.getFullYear() - devStartYear
          } years, managing teams for 
          {
            now.getFullYear() - mgmtStartYear
          }. I help teams grow through both coding and coaching.

        <p>I live in Los Angeles with my wife and two children.</p>
