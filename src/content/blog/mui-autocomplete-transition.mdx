Working with Next.js and Relay over the past year, I have also found myself exploring
React's Transitions. As explained in the [React v18.0 blog posted on March
29](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18),
2022, Transitions are used to "distinguish between urgent and non-urgent
updates". As explained in the article:

> For example, when you select a filter in a dropdown, you expect the filter
> button itself to respond immediately when you click. However, the actual
> results may transition separately. A small delay would be imperceptible and
> often expected. And if you change the filter again before the results are done
> rendering, you only care to see the latest results.
>
> Typically, for the best user experience, a single user input should result in
both an urgent update and a non-urgent one.

Let's test that out. Here's an autocomplete that is sync.

<Example1 client:load />
