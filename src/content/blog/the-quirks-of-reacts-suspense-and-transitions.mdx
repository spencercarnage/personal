I spent 2024 working on refactoring a CRA SPA to a Next.js app using Relay to
fetch data. Over the course of this project I have found myself using React's
Suspense and Transitions a lot more than I did previously. I had very minimal
experience with Suspense but none when it came to Transitions.

After months of using `<Suspense>`, `useTransition`, `useLazyLoadQuery`,
`useQueryLoader`, and `loading.tsx`, I realized I still couldn't confidently
explain their quirks. This post is my deep dive into how Transitions work, along
with some unexpected behaviors I encountered.

## React Transitions

What exactly is a Transition? As explained in the
[React v18.0 blog posted on March 29, 2022](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18),
Transitions are used to "distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates".

> For example, when you select a filter in a dropdown, you expect the filter
> button itself to respond immediately when you click. However, the actual
> results may transition separately. A small delay would be imperceptible and
> often expected. And if you change the filter again before the results are done
> rendering, you only care to see the latest results.
>
> Typically, for the best user experience, a single user input should result in
> both an urgent update and a non-urgent one.

An interesting explanation nonetheless, it does not adequately capture how
Transitions work, and how to use them. A contrived example is in order.

## Select Your Favorite Dessert

Here's an autocomplete for selecting a dessert that does not use `<Suspense>`.

<NonTransitionExample client:only="react" />

When you select a dessert that has flavor options (there are no flavor options
for "Mom's Famous Chocolate Chip Cookies"), another autocomplete is rendered
below it, prompting you to select a dessert flavor. The flavors are fetched from
an API, which means we want to show a loading state while that fetch is
happening. Once the flavors have finished loading, `<FlavorAutocomplete>`'s
loading state has been replaced with flavors for the dessert option you chose.
(If the dessert has flavor options.)

Suspense is not being used to render a fallback UI while the data is loading.
Even if there was Suspense being used, the data fetching itself is not
"Suspense-enabled".

## Suspense-enabled

[Per React's documentation, "Suspense-enabled" means the following](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense):

> 1. Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js
> 1. Lazy-loading component code with `lazy`
> 1. Reading the value of a cached Promise with `use`

In the example below, the `<FlavorAutocomplete>` component triggers a Transition
when it fetches data. However the `<FlavorAutocomplete>` does not have its own
Suspense wrapped around it. This causes the Transition to show the nearest
parent's Suspense fallback. That happens to be app's Suspense. Selecting a
dessert will show the "App Loading..." UI from the app's Suspense fallback.

<AppSuspenseOnlyExample client:only="react" />

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
<Suspense fallback="App Loading...">
  <DessertAutocomplete onChange={handleChange} />

  {selectedDessert && selectedDessert.value !== "famous_cookies" && (
    <FlavorAutocomplete {...} />
  )}
</Suspense>
```

You can think of `<Suspense>` as a boundary that catches Transitions bubbling up
from its child components. When a Transition occurs, Suspense temporarily
replaces the affected UI with a fallback, making loading states easier to
manage. This reduces code that we would otherwise write and manage ourselves.

What we want is to show loading UI for the `<FlavorAutocomplete>` only.

Wrapping our `<FlavorAutocomplete>` with its own Suspense prevents the
Transition from "bubbling up " unnecessarily to the wrong Suspense. Selecting a
dessert in the next example, the user will see a message like "Loading
\<selected dessert\> flavors..." coming from the Suspense that is wrapping the
`<FlavorAutocomplete>`.

<SuspenseWithUseExample client:only="react" />

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
<Suspense fallback="App Loading...">
  <DessertAutocomplete onChange={handleChange} />

  <Suspense fallback={`Loading ${selectedDessert?.label} flavors...`}>
    {selectedDessert && selectedDessert.value !== "famous_cookies" && (
      <FlavorAutocomplete {...} />
    )}
  </Suspense>
</Suspense>
```

Success! We have set up our `<FlavorAutocomplete>` with Suspense to show the
correct loading UI. Feel free to read
[React's own documentation on the Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)
to learn more about how this works.

## Tapping Into The Suspended Component's Loading State

Our `<FlavorAutocomplete>` comes with its own loading state. Below is an example
of what that loading state looks like, three pulsating dots. Clicking the
`<FlavorAutocomplete>` while it is loading will show a "Loading..." text where
the options would be.

<LoadingSelectExample client:only="react" />

If our `<FlavorAutocomplete>` is wrapped in a Suspense, it will replace
`<FlavorAutocomplete>` with the fallback UI while fetching data. The drawback to
this is that we can not use `<FlavorAutocomplete>`'s own loading UI.

Why would we want to use `<FlavorAutocomplete>`'s own loading UI over the
Suspense fallback?

Our form could have a number of inputs that do not rely on asynchronous data.
Showing all of the inputs immediately would be preferred over loading UI that
blocks the user from interacting with the non-async inputs. But Suspense is
all-or-nothing. However, without a Suspense component, the Transition from
fetching desserts flavors could "bubble up" to the wrong Suspense, resulting in
an undesirable experience.

How can we use Suspense while showing our `<FlavorAutocomplete>` in a loading
state?

## Dummy Fallback Select

One way to achieve an interactive form that uses Suspense would be to create a
"dummy" `<FallbackFlavorAutocomplete>` component that we render with the
`fallback` prop. You end up with a fully functioning `<FlavorAutocomplete>`
input that is displaying a "loading" state. Once your actual
`<FlavorAutocomplete>` has finished fetching data, you show that instead.

<SuspenseWithDummyFallbackExample client:only="react" />

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<FallbackFlavorAutocomplete />}>
  <FlavorAutocomplete />
</Suspense>
```

A problem with this dummy fallback approach is apparent when the user tries to
interact with `<FallbackFlavorAutocomplete>` while the `<FlavorAutocomplete>` is
suspended.

A user clicking on `<FallbackFlavorAutocomplete>` will see an empty dropdown
list with the word "Loading...". If the select is open when the data has
finished fetching, the dropdown will close on them. That is because
`<FallbackFlavorAutocomplete>` is being replaced with `<FlavorAutocomplete>`.
This can be a jarring experience for the user.

We could make it so that the user is unable to open the dropdown on the dummy
fallback select. Why would we not want to do this? There's a reason why select
components that asynchronously load their options will show an empty dropdown
that says "Loading...": its enhances the user experience, if only a little.

Albeit contrived, real world examples of this problem do exist. But there is a
solution: `startTransition`.

## `startTransition`

Suspense helps handle loading states bubbling up, but what if we need to manage
loading within a component? Thatâ€™s where `startTransition` comes in. The
`useTransition` hook (and the `isPending` value it gives us) should be able to
help with this.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
const [dessert, setDessert] = useState(null);
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

const handleClick = (dessert) => {
  startTransition(() => {
    setDessert(dessert);
  });
};
```

By calling `setDessert` in `startTransition`, we should be able to render
`<FlavorAutocomplete>` in a loading state due the `isLoading={isPending}` prop
we pass to it.

This is the code we are using to render `<FlavorAutocomplete>`.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
{dessert && <FlavorAutocomplete loading={isPending} />}
```

Let's give it a shot.

<StartTransitionExample client:only="react" />

That's interesting. Did you catch that?

The first time a dessert with flavors is selected, there is no change to the UI
until the Transition has finished. Subsequent Transitions will result in the
`<FlavorAutocomplete>` being rendered in a loading state for the duration of the
Transition. The "Select a \<dessert\> flavor" text does not update until the
Transition has completed.

Why do we not see the `<FlavorAutocomplete>` immediately when the first
Transition has started? Since `<FlavorAutocomplete>` was not initially rendered,
it did not show up until after that first Transition completed.

<strong>
  While `isPending` can help with showing a loading state, it can only do so
  after the component has been mounted.
</strong>

## Conditionally Loading With `isPending`

While we can not use `isPending` in the first render of a component that was
mounted in response to a Transition, we can use that Transition's `isPending` in
other ways. The example below follows the same logic as the one above, with one
exception: the text of `isPending: true` _is_ being rendered as soon as the
first Transition starts, with the following code:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
{isPending && "isPending: true"}
{dessert && <FlavorAutocomplete isLoading={isPending} />}
```

See it in action:

<FirstTransitionIsPendingExample client:only="react" />

But this one appears to have an easy fix, right?

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
{isPending && "isPending: true"}
{(isPending || dessert) && <FlavorAutocomplete isLoading={isPending} />}
```

Nope.

<CombinedIsPendingWithStateExample client:only="react" />

This doesnâ€™t just delay `<FlavorAutocomplete>` on the first Transitionâ€”it never
renders during any Transition, breaking our expected behavior.

## Console Logging `isPending` Breaks My Brain

`isPending` behaves oddly in logs: the render-time value flips to false almost
immediately, while `useEffect` correctly reflects the duration of the
Transition.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

console.log("on render", { isPending });

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("in useEffect", { isPending });
}, [isPending]);
```

The "on render" console log will show the value as `true`, immediately followed
by it changing back to `false`. This is different from the "in useEffect"
console log which shows `true` for the duration of the Transition, switching
back to `false` when the Transition has completed.

Open your browser dev tools and see for yourself:

<IsPendingConsoleExample client:only="react" />

As a champion console logger, this was an interesting quirk to discover.

## Conclusion

While working on a large-scale effort to convert a CRA app to Next.js, I was
working more with Suspense and Transitions&mdash;concepts that I had only
lightly explored before. While Suspense provided a powerful mechanism for
handling async rendering, its behavior wasn't always intuitive, particularly in
how Transitions interacted with it. While, `useTransition` allows for finer
control over Transitions, its quirks&mdash;like not affecting the initial
render&mdash;make it an imperfect solution for some use cases.
